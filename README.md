My Lottery Game
Hey there! Welcome to my Lottery Game—a super fun web project I built to bring some excitement and sparkle to the browser! I coded this from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m stoked about how it turned out. Picture this: glowing boxes that dance around, a starry night sky in the background, and cool sound effects that make you feel like you’re on a game show. It’s my take on a lottery, and I poured my love for creative visuals into it. Wanna give it a spin? Let’s dive in!
What’s Cool About It

Eye-Candy Visuals: The boxes have this neon glow with a 3D tilt effect, and they pop against a twinkling starry backdrop. It’s like a cosmic party!
Fun Gameplay: Hit the "Pick a number" button, and watch the boxes light up randomly for 5 seconds before revealing your prize. It’s suspenseful and addicting!
Sound Effects: I added a spinning wheel sound (spin.mp3) and a cheerful win jingle (completed.mp3) to crank up the vibe.
Works Everywhere: I made sure it looks great on your phone, tablet, or laptop.
50 Unique Prizes: From cash to gadgets to quirky stuff like a teddy bear, there’s something for everyone.

What You Need to Run It
Not much! Just:

A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, whatever you use)
A code editor if you wanna tweak it (I use VS Code)
A way to run a local server (optional, but I’ll explain below)

How to Set It Up

Grab the Code:
git clone https://github.com/vvsprasad9/LotteryGame.git
cd your-repo-name


What’s in the Folder:
LotteryGame/

├── index.html       // The main game page

├── script.js        // The brain behind the game

├── spin.mp3         // Sound for the spinning action

├── completed.mp3    // Sound for when you win

└── README.md        // This file!



Get the Audio Files:

You’ll need spin.mp3 (a short 1-2 second spinning wheel sound) and completed.mp3 (a 2-4 second win jingle).
I got mine from free sites like Mixkit or TunePocket. Search for “prize wheel spin” and “game show win” sounds. Make sure they’re MP3s and royalty-free!
Drop these files in the project folder.


Run It:

Double-click index.html to open it in your browser, or
Fire up a local server for a smoother experience. If you have VS Code, the Live Server extension is awesome. Or try:npx live-server





How to Play

Open the game in your browser.
Click Pick a number to kick things off.
Watch the boxes flash one by one with a cool spinning sound for 5 seconds.
When it stops, a box lights up with a golden glow and a jingle, showing your prize—like “You Won a Bluetooth Speaker!” Try it and see what you get!

What I Used to Build It

HTML: For the layout and structure.
CSS: For all the fancy animations, neon effects, and that starry sky.
JavaScript: To make the game pick random prizes, play sounds, and control the animations.
